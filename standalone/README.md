# Standalone Scripts

Before following the [docs](https://docs.openstack.org/project-deploy-guide/tripleo-docs/latest/deployment/standalone.html) I set up a VM to run standalone one of two ways.

- [metalsmith](metalsmith): If I have a working undercloud w/ metalsmith from tripleo-lab
- [virsh](virsh): If I only have a new centos-stream8 VM from virsh commands
